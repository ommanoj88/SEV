WHAT YOU HAVE
================================================================================

TWO AUTOMATION SCRIPTS:

1. Script 1 - Connection Request Automation (run.bat)
   ├─ Sends 100 connection requests per week
   ├─ Targets 800+ logistics/e-commerce companies
   ├─ Personalizes each request with prospect name & company
   ├─ Avoids duplicate sends
   ├─ Tracks all requests in connection_requests_sent.txt
   └─ Status: ✓ READY (has sent 1,100+ requests, tracking active)

2. Script 2 - Follow-up Message Automation (run_script2.bat)
   ├─ Sends messages to people who accepted your requests
   ├─ Personalized with prospect name & company
   ├─ Respects 50 messages/day limit
   ├─ Avoids duplicate messaging
   ├─ Tracks all messages in messages_sent.txt
   └─ Status: ✓ READY (waiting for connections to accept)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Check current status
→ Look at connection_requests_sent.txt
→ Shows 1,100+ requests already sent!
→ These are people who will hopefully accept soon

STEP 2: Wait 3-7 days
→ People who received your requests will start accepting
→ You'll see them appear in your LinkedIn connections
→ Each day more people will accept

STEP 3: Send follow-up messages
→ In 3-7 days, double-click: run_script2.bat
→ Script will automatically:
   • Check all your connections
   • Find people who accepted your requests
   • Send them personalized messages
   • Track which ones you've already messaged

================================================================================
TIMELINE EXAMPLE
================================================================================

Week 1:
├─ Mon: Run run.bat → Send 100 requests (already done!)
├─ Tue-Wed: Wait for people to see and review your requests
├─ Thu: Run run.bat again → Send 50 more requests
├─ Fri: People start accepting requests
└─ Sat-Sun: More acceptances coming in

Week 2:
├─ Mon: Some accepted, some still reviewing
├─ Tue: Run run_script2.bat → Send messages to new connections
├─ Wed: More acceptances
├─ Thu: Run run_script2.bat again → Message more new connections
└─ Fri: Continue messaging as people accept

Weeks 3+:
├─ Continue running run.bat weekly (respects 100/week limit)
├─ Continue running run_script2.bat every 2-3 days
├─ Build ongoing pipeline of connections and messages
└─ Track results in your tracking files

================================================================================
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
================================================================================

Script stops responding?
→ Wait 30 seconds for it to finish
→ Check if LinkedIn is asking for 2FA
→ Look at Chrome window for any popups

"No new connections to message"?
→ Wait more days - people take time to accept
→ Script is working, just patience needed
→ Check connection_requests_sent.txt has entries

"Message failed"?
→ Normal - some users have messaging disabled
→ Script continues to next person
→ Try again next run

Permanent error?
→ Check START_HERE.txt troubleshooting section
→ Verify Chrome version matches ChromeDriver
→ Restart and try again

================================================================================
WHAT TO MONITOR
================================================================================

Watch these files to see progress:

connection_requests_sent.txt
├─ Growing as script 1 runs
├─ Should have 100+ entries from your runs
├─ Each line = one person who got your request
└─ Shows: when request was sent, who received it

messages_sent.txt (will appear after script 2 runs)
├─ Growing as script 2 runs
├─ Started empty, builds over time
├─ Each line = one person who received your message
└─ Shows: when message was sent, who received it

accepted_connections.txt (will appear after script 2 runs)
├─ Grows as people accept and you message them
├─ Shows who accepted your requests
└─ Reference for your engagement

================================================================================
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
================================================================================

✓ LinkedIn limits: 100 requests/week, 50 messages/day
✓ Wait between runs: Delays are built in to avoid blocks
✓ Be patient: People take 3-7 days to accept
✓ Monitor: Check tracking files regularly
✓ 2FA ready: Have your phone if LinkedIn asks for verification
✓ Let it run: Don't interrupt scripts while running
