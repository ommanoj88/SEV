# Deep Dive: Driver Performance Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Feature:** Driver Performance Tracking
**Status:** 👻 **Ghost Feature**

This report analyzes the implementation of Driver Performance Tracking.

## 1. Executive Summary
The system claims to track driver performance (Safety Score, Efficiency, Leaderboard), but the backend **does not store or calculate these metrics**. The `Driver` entity only tracks `totalTrips` and `totalDistance`. The frontend `DriverLeaderboard` component displays fields that simply do not exist in the API response, meaning it is either using mock data or is broken.

## 2. Backend Analysis (`Driver.java`)
**Status:** ❌ **Missing Data Model**

*   **Existing Fields:**
    *   `totalTrips`: Integer.
    *   `totalDistance`: Double.
*   **Missing Fields:**
    *   `safetyScore` (0-100).
    *   `fuelEfficiency` (km/L or kWh/100km).
    *   `harshBrakingEvents`, `speedingEvents`, `idlingTime`.
*   **Missing Logic:**
    *   No service to analyze `Trip` data and update a score.

## 3. Frontend Analysis (`DriverLeaderboard.tsx`)
**Status:** 🚧 **Fantasy UI**

*   **Code Evidence:**
    ```typescript
    <TableCell>{entry.safetyScore}/100</TableCell>
    <TableCell>{entry.fuelEfficiency.toFixed(1)}</TableCell>
    ```
*   **Disconnect:** The Redux state `leaderboard` expects these fields, but the backend `DriverService.getAllDrivers` returns `DriverResponse` which **does not have them**.
*   **Result:** The table will either be empty, show "undefined", or crash.

## 4. Impact
*   **No Accountability:** Bad drivers (speeding, harsh braking) cannot be identified.
*   **No Incentives:** Good drivers cannot be rewarded.
*   **Misleading Dashboard:** The "Leaderboard" promises insights it cannot deliver.

## 5. Recommendations

### 1. Update Data Model
*   Add `DriverPerformance` entity (OneToOne with Driver).
*   Fields: `safety_score`, `efficiency_score`, `harsh_events`, `last_updated`.

### 2. Implement Scoring Engine
*   Create a `ScoringService`.
*   Listen to `TripCompletedEvent`.
*   Analyze telemetry (speed, braking) to calculate a score for that trip.
*   Update the driver's rolling average.

### 3. Real Telematics Integration
*   The system needs input from the vehicle (IoT) to know *how* it was driven, not just *where*.

## Summary
The "Leaderboard" is currently a placeholder. To make it real, the system needs to track *behavior*, not just *distance*.
