# Deep Dive: Charging Session Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Feature:** Charging Session Tracking
**Status:** ✅ **Fixed (Thread-Safe + Validated)**

This report analyzes the implementation of Charging Session Tracking.

## 1. Executive Summary
The feature allows starting and stopping charging sessions with proper thread-safety and data validation. Real-time monitoring remains to be implemented.

## 2. Backend Analysis (`ChargingSessionService`, `Controller`)
**Status:** ✅ **Fixed**

*   **Race Condition (Critical):** ✅ **FIXED** - `startSession` now uses atomic database operations.
    ```java
    // ChargingSessionService.java
    int rowsUpdated = stationRepository.decrementAvailableSlots(stationId);
    if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No available slots at this station");
    }
    ```
    *   **Solution:** Atomic database operations prevent multiple vehicles from reserving the same slot.
*   **Validation:** ✅ **FIXED** - Added proper validation:
    *   `energyConsumed` must be zero or positive using `@PositiveOrZero`
    *   `initialSoc` and `finalSoc` validated between 0-100 using `@DecimalMin`/`@DecimalMax`
    *   Additional runtime validation in service methods
*   **No Fuel Support:** As with other modules, this is strictly for EVs. No concept of "Fueling Session". **(Future Work)**

## 3. Frontend Analysis (`ChargingManagementPage.tsx`)
**Status:** ⚠️ **Basic Table Only**

*   **No Real-Time Monitor:** There is no component to show live charging progress (e.g., a battery animation filling up). **(Future Work)**
*   **Manual Refresh:** You must refresh the page to see if a session has finished.
*   **UI:** The table is functional but basic.

## 4. Impact - RESOLVED
*   ✅ **Billing Errors:** Validation prevents negative energy values
*   ✅ **Physical Conflicts:** Atomic operations prevent multiple vehicles on the same charger
*   ⚠️ **User Experience:** Real-time monitoring remains for future work

## 5. Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Race Condition
Replaced check-and-act with atomic database operations:
```java
// Thread-safe slot reservation
int rowsUpdated = stationRepository.decrementAvailableSlots(stationId);
if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("No available slots at this station");
}
```

### 2. ✅ Added Validation
Added comprehensive validation in `ChargingSession` entity:
```java
@PositiveOrZero(message = "Energy consumed must be zero or positive")
private BigDecimal energyConsumed;

@DecimalMin(value = "0.0", message = "Initial SOC must be between 0 and 100")
@DecimalMax(value = "100.0", message = "Initial SOC must be between 0 and 100")
private Double initialSoc;
```

Added runtime validation in `ChargingSessionService`:
```java
if (initialSoc != null && (initialSoc < 0.0 || initialSoc > 100.0)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial SOC must be between 0 and 100");
}
```

### 3. ⚠️ Build Real-Time Monitor (Future Work)
Create a `ChargingMonitor` component that uses WebSockets (once implemented) to show live graphs of energy flow.

## Summary
The session tracking now provides reliable, thread-safe operation with proper validation. Real-time monitoring is noted for future enhancement.
