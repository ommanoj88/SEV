# Deep Dive: Preventive Maintenance Alerts Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Feature:** Preventive Maintenance Alerts
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED - Optimized Backend**

This report analyzes the implementation of Preventive Maintenance Alerts.

## 1. Executive Summary
**UPDATE (2025-11-19):** The alerts feature has been optimized with a dedicated backend endpoint that efficiently retrieves and prioritizes maintenance alerts. The heavy client-side logic has been moved to the server, improving performance and scalability.

## 2. Backend Analysis
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

*   **New Implementation:**
    *   Created `MaintenanceAlertResponse` DTO with priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
    *   Added optimized database query `findUpcomingMaintenanceAlerts()` that:
        *   Filters by company and date range at database level
        *   Excludes completed/cancelled records
        *   Returns only relevant data
    *   Implemented `MaintenanceService.getMaintenanceAlerts()` method that:
        *   Calculates days until due for each record
        *   Assigns priority based on urgency (overdue = HIGH, <7 days = MEDIUM, <30 days = LOW)
        *   Sorts by priority and date
        *   Joins with vehicle data for display
    *   Added REST endpoint: GET `/api/v1/maintenance/alerts?companyId={id}&daysAhead={days}`
*   **Performance Improvement:**
    *   Query executes on database with proper filtering
    *   Returns only top N alerts (configurable)
    *   Eliminates need to fetch all vehicles and schedules

## 3. Frontend Analysis (`MaintenanceAlertsCard.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ **OPTIMIZED**

*   **Original Issue:** Component fetched ALL vehicles and ALL schedules, then filtered in browser
*   **New Implementation:**
    *   Updated to call single optimized endpoint: `maintenanceService.getMaintenanceAlerts()`
    *   Removed heavy client-side filtering logic
    *   Backend handles all business logic (priority calculation, sorting)
    *   Improved performance for large fleets (1000+ vehicles)
*   **Business Logic:** Now centralized on server, ensuring consistency across web and mobile apps

## 4. Scheduled Tasks (Future Enhancement)
**Status:** 🔄 **Foundation Ready**

*   The backend service methods are in place and can be called by:
    *   Spring `@Scheduled` tasks for daily summaries
    *   Email/SMS notification service integration
    *   Mobile push notification triggers
*   **Note:** Scheduled tasks and notifications can be added as needed without modifying core logic

## 5. Impact of Fix
*   **Scalability:** Dashboard remains responsive even with large datasets
*   **Performance:** Single optimized query vs. multiple API calls + client filtering
*   **Consistency:** Business logic on server ensures uniform behavior
*   **API Efficiency:** Reduced data transfer and client processing

## Summary
The preventive alerts feature now uses an optimized backend endpoint that handles filtering, prioritization, and sorting. This eliminates the scalability issues of the original client-side implementation while providing a foundation for future notification features.
