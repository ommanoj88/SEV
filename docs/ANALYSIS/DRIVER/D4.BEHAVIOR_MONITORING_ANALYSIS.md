# Deep Dive: Driver Behavior Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Feature:** Driver Behavior Monitoring
**Status:** 👻 **Ghost Feature**

This report analyzes the implementation of Driver Behavior Monitoring.

## 1. Executive Summary
The system claims to monitor driver behavior (Harsh Braking, Speeding, Idling), but there is **absolutely no implementation** of this feature. There are no database tables to store these events, no API endpoints to ingest them from vehicle telematics, and no logic to analyze them.

## 2. Backend Analysis
**Status:** ❌ **Non-Existent**

*   **Missing Entities:**
    *   No `DriverBehavior` or `DrivingEvent` tables.
*   **Missing Events:**
    *   No `HarshBrakingEvent`, `SpeedingEvent`, `RapidAccelerationEvent`.
*   **Missing Ingestion:**
    *   The `VehicleController` only accepts `latitude`/`longitude`. It does not accept accelerometer data or OBD-II codes.

## 3. Frontend Analysis
**Status:** ❌ **Non-Existent**

*   **No UI:**
    *   There are no charts showing "Speeding Events per Trip".
    *   The "Safety Score" on the Leaderboard is a hardcoded/fake number (as confirmed in D3).

## 4. Impact
*   **Safety Risk:** Dangerous driving goes undetected.
*   **Cost Risk:** Aggressive driving increases fuel consumption and wear-and-tear, but the system cannot identify the root cause.
*   **Insurance:** Cannot implement usage-based insurance (UBI) models.

## 5. Recommendations

### 1. Telematics Ingestion
*   Create an endpoint `POST /api/v1/telematics/events`.
*   Accept JSON: `{ "type": "HARSH_BRAKING", "gForce": 2.5, "timestamp": "..." }`.

### 2. Event Storage
*   Create `DrivingEvent` entity (linked to `Trip` and `Driver`).
*   Store the location and severity of each event.

### 3. Analysis Engine
*   Run a nightly job to aggregate events and update the `DriverPerformance` score.

## Summary
The system is blind to *how* the vehicle is being driven. It only knows *where* it is.
