# Deep Dive: Customer Management Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Feature:** Customer & Feedback Management
**Status:** 👻 **Ghost Feature (Frontend Only)**

This report analyzes the implementation of Customer Management.

## 1. Executive Summary
**The feature does not exist in the backend.**

The Frontend has a detailed "Customer Management" page that allows managing customer profiles (Individual/Business), tracking deliveries, and collecting feedback. However, the Backend **has no code** to store this data.

## 2. Frontend Analysis (`CustomerManagementPage.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ **Fully Implemented (UI)**

*   **Features:**
    *   **Profiles:** Manage Name, Contact, Address, GSTIN/PAN.
    *   **Types:** Support for Individual vs. Business customers.
    *   **Feedback:** UI to submit ratings (1-5 stars) and comments.
    *   **Stats:** Dashboard for "Top Rated", "Active", "Pending Feedback".
*   **API Calls:**
    *   `GET /api/customers`
    *   `POST /api/customers`
    *   `POST /api/customers/feedback`

## 3. Backend Analysis
**Status:** ❌ **Completely Missing**

*   **No Entity:** There is no `Customer` or `CustomerFeedback` class in the Java code.
*   **No Controller:** There is no `CustomerController`.
*   **No Logic:** There is no code to link a `Trip` to a `Customer`.
*   **Result:** Any attempt to create a customer will result in a `404 Not Found` error from the server.

## 4. Impact
*   **No CRM:** You cannot maintain a database of clients.
*   **No Feedback Loop:** You cannot collect or analyze customer satisfaction.
*   **Billing Issues:** Without customer data (GSTIN, Address), you cannot generate invoices.

## 5. Recommendations

### 1. Create the Backend
You need to build the entire vertical slice:
*   **Entities:** `Customer`, `CustomerFeedback`.
*   **Controller:** `CustomerController`.
*   **Service:** `CustomerService`.

### 2. Integrate with Trips
*   Update `Trip` entity to include `customerId`.
*   When a trip completes, trigger a "Request Feedback" notification.

## Summary
The system has a beautiful CRM interface that connects to nothing.
